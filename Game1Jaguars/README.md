# Seahawks Fall 2025

Captains:
- Arthur
- Ben

## September 19: Jaguars

- Loss 13-18
- We had a chance at the end
- Passing playbook between coach was inefficient
  - Joe only needs playbook to call out players, not to refer the plays
- Lost our game ball at end
- No penalties for:
  - Offsides
  - Illegal formation
  - Delay of game
- Had to burn two timeouts to prevent delay of game penalties
